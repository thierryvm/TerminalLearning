# Roadmap — Terminal Learning

> Last updated: 9 April 2026

---

## Vision

An open-source, free, interactive terminal learning platform targeting **schools and universities**
as a pedagogical tool to train autonomous full-stack developers — from absolute beginners to
professionals who leverage AI as a tool, not a replacement.

---

## Phase 0 — Deployment ✅
- [x] Vite + React + TypeScript app deployed on Vercel
- [x] SPA routing + security headers
- [x] GitHub Actions CI (type-check → lint → test → build)

## Phase 1 — Landing + Content ✅
- [x] Landing page + routing (/, /app, /privacy)
- [x] Interactive terminal engine
- [x] Lesson curriculum + progress tracking
- [x] GDPR + SEO + OpenGraph image

## Phase 2 — Observability ✅
- [x] Vercel Analytics (cookieless, GDPR-compliant)
- [x] Sentry error tracking (frontend) — EU endpoint (ingest.de.sentry.io)

## Phase 3 — User Accounts ✅
- [x] Supabase Auth — email/password + OAuth GitHub + Google
- [x] DB schema + RLS (profiles + progress tables)
- [x] Progress sync: localStorage + Supabase hybrid (never downgrades)
- [x] Security hardening: HSTS, CSP, rate limiting

## Phase 3.5 — UX & Auth upgrade ✅
- [x] Animated terminal hero
- [x] Sidebar auth (UserMenu, sync badge)
- [x] OAuth loading states, TOKEN_REFRESHED sync fix
- [x] 160+ unit tests

## Phase 4 — Curriculum v2 + Environment Selection ✅
- [x] Multi-environment support: Linux, macOS, Windows
- [x] Environment selector on landing + sidebar
- [x] Terminal engine: 30+ PowerShell aliases, macOS/Windows commands
- [x] Env-aware exercises: validate/hint/instruction per environment
- [x] Contextual help system: `help <cmd>` returns targeted help per env
- [x] Terminal profiles per env: prompt style, path format, MOTD
  - Linux: `user@hostname:~$` — bash green
  - macOS: `➜ ~` — zsh violet (Oh My Zsh style)
  - Windows: `PS C:\Users\user>` — PowerShell cyan
- [x] 192 unit tests

## Phase 5 — Curriculum Expansion 🔄 In progress
